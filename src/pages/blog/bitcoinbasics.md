# What is Bitcoin 
Bitcoin is digital money based on Blockchain technology. There is chain of Blocks linked to each other and Blocks comntain transactions.

Suppose I give u a 100 rs in front of five people then five people become bank insuring you have taken 100 rs from me.

This five people are computer/Node where Software is running and verifying each transaction.This is called Bitcoin network.

Suppose 100 such transactions are confirmed by the network , then miner(Node) put all this transactions into a block and find a hash number.This hash number is unique and very hard to find which make network secure. 

Now the Block is created and propagated to rest of the network.The first transaction of any Block is very special.The first transaction is teh Bitcoin.
So whenever a Block is mined , one Bitcoin is generated.

This network is very planned and geniuosly created. This is not less than invention.
Network is very smart.It knows when and how much Blocks should be mined by increasing and decreasing difficulty rate.

2020 is very crucial for two news. Bitcoin reward is halving which has vey much impact on its price.$20k I guess.Lightning network is also play vital role for small transactions.
